# Introduction

The [Vollo SDK](https://github.com/MyrtleSoftware/vollo-sdk) is designed for
low latency streaming inference of machine learning (ML) models on FPGA
platforms.

You can estimate the latency of your model using the Vollo SDK without needing
an FPGA or a Vollo license, see [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for
details.
