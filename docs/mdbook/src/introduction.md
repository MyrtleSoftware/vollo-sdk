# Introduction

The [Vollo SDK](https://github.com/MyrtleSoftware/vollo-sdk) is designed for
low latency streaming inference of machine learning (ML) models on FPGA
platforms.

## Evaluation

You can easily discover the latency Vollo can achieve for your models, without
needing an FPGA or a Vollo license. Use the online Vollo Sandbox
[here](https://sandbox.vollo.myrtle.ai).

Alternatively, you can download and install the Vollo SDK on your own computer
if you wish to evaluate Vollo offline. You won't need an FPGA or a Vollo
license for this either. See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for details.
