# Initial Setup

This section describes how to program your accelerator card with the VOLLO
Accelerator upon first use and how to reprogram your accelerator card with
updated versions of the VOLLO Accelerator.
It also describes how to obtain a VOLLO license which you will need to use the
VOLLO accelerator.

## Environment Variable Setup

The initial setup instructions should be run in the VOLLO SDK directory.

```bash
> cd vollo-sdk-<VERSION>
```

When using VOLLO, you should also have the `setup.sh` script sourced to set up
environment variables used by VOLLO:

```bash
> source setup.sh
```
