# Benchmarks

This section provides benchmarks for the Vollo accelerator for a variety of models.

Performance figures are given for two configurations of the Vollo accelerator.
A three big core configuration which is provided for the IA-840F accelerator card
and a six small core configuration which is provided for the IA-420F accelerator card.
If you require a different configuration, please contact us at <vollo@myrtle.ai>.

All these performance numbers can be measured using the `vollo-sdk` with the correct accelerator card
by running the provided [benchmark script](running-the-benchmark.md).

We also provide performance figures for a PCIe roundtrip for various input and output sizes.
